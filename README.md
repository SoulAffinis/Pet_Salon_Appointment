Python program for a pet salon to schedule appointments for customers.
This is a simple Python program targeting pet owners who would like to schedule an appointment for a pet salon.
Program starts with a main menu where customers can select from various options on what they would like to do.
Their choices will include making an appointment, viewing services provided, salon information, as well as checking prices for services.
Appointments can be made for just one visit as well as the availability to reserve dates for the next four appointments.
Customers will have to input their pet's weight in order to get a proper estimate on a subtotal price for service.
After appointments have been made, customer and appointment information will be available to view in a text file which can then be printed.
